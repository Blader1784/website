        <h2 style="color:#fa403c; text-align: center;">Slide Tackle Only</h2>
        <p style="color: #fa403c;">When you play for Ajax, you're part of something bigger than just a football team.
          This club is built on history, on philosophy, and on trust in youth. From the moment you step into De Toekomst (our academy), you're taught to play the Ajax way — fast, technical, and fearless. Every training session pushes you, every match means something.
          
          We've both come through different paths, but here, we're united by the same vision: to keep the legacy alive while writing the next chapter.
          From the Cruyff days to now, Ajax has always been about more than trophies — it's about identity, development, and daring to dream big.
          
          This is Ajax. This is home.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#fa403c; text-align: center; column-span: none;">Vallskib's Army</h2>
        <p style="color: #fa403c;">At Bayern Munich, excellence isn't a goal — it's the standard.
          From the moment you walk into Säbener Straße, you feel the weight of tradition and the drive for success. This club has a winning mentality built into its DNA. Every training, every match, every moment — you’re expected to give everything.
          
          We come from different places, but here, we wear the same crest with pride. The club expects a lot from us — and we expect a lot from ourselves.
          Whether it's Bundesliga titles, Champions League nights, or just pushing each other to be better, Bayern is about more than just football. It’s about discipline, unity, and never settling for second best.
          
          Mia san Mia isn't just a slogan. It's who we are.</p>

          From the moment you arrive, you feel the energy of Anfield, the passion of the fans, and the legacy of legends. It's not just about the trophies; it's about the pride in wearing this jersey, the unity we share on the pitch, and the unwavering support we get from the people of Liverpool.
          
          We come from different backgrounds, but when we step onto that field, we're united by one goal: to give everything for the badge and for the fans.
          Whether we're facing rivals in the Premier League or fighting for glory in Europe, it's always about one thing — winning together, with heart, with belief, and with courage.
          
          You'll never walk alone (Unless your name is Trent). </p>

          We come from different places, but in Mumbai, we are one. This is a city that never gives up, and that's the spirit we bring to the field.

          From the very first moment you pull on the yellow jersey, you understand what it means to represent this team: pride, excellence, and an unrelenting desire to win. The energy of the supporters, the spirit of the club, and the ambition to always be the best — that's what drives us.
          
          We come from different places, but when we step onto the field, we share the same dream: to take Sundowns to greater heights. The journey to dominance in South African football is far from over, and every match is a chance to prove we're the best.
          
          From league titles to continental glory, this club never settles. It's not just about winning — it's about setting the standard and leading the way for the future of African football.
